# Pig-Game
A simple Two-player fun to play game.

Rules:

2. If the dice rolls 1, then turn switches to the next player and all the points collected will be lost.
3. If a player decides to hold, the points scored are added to total points and the turn is switched to the next player.
4. The first player to reach 100 points, wins.
